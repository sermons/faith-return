# Opening **Question**

[###](#/outline "secret")

[1](# "ref")
Now listen, you rich people, weep and wail <br>
because of the misery that is coming on you.

[2](# "ref")
Your wealth has rotted, <br>
and moths have eaten your clothes.

[3](# "ref")
Your gold and silver are corroded. <br>
Their corrosion will testify against you <br>
and eat your flesh like fire.

---
You have hoarded wealth in the last days.

[4](# "ref")
Look! The wages you failed to pay the workers <br>
who mowed your fields are crying out against you.

The cries of the harvesters have reached <br>
the ears of the Lord Almighty.

---
[5](# "ref")
You have lived on earth <br>
in luxury and self-indulgence. <br>
You have fattened yourselves <br>
in the day of slaughter.

[6](# "ref")
You have condemned and murdered the innocent one, <br>
who was not opposing you.

---
[7](# "ref")
Be patient, then, brothers and sisters, <br>
until the Lord’s coming.

See how the farmer waits for the land <br>
to yield its valuable crop, <br>
patiently waiting for the autumn and spring rains.

---
[8](# "ref")
You too, be patient and stand firm, <br>
because the Lord’s coming is near.

[9](# "ref")
Don’t grumble against one another, <br>
brothers and sisters, or you will be judged.

The Judge is standing at the door!

---
[10](# "ref")
Brothers and sisters, as an example <br>
of patience in the face of suffering, <br>
take the prophets who spoke in the name of the Lord.

[11](# "ref")
As you know, we count as blessed <br>
those who have persevered.

You have heard of Job’s perseverance <br>
and have seen what the Lord finally brought about. <br>
The Lord is full of compassion and mercy.
